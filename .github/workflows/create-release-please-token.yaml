          This workflow is intentionally informational.

          To avoid using a PAT, configure a GitHub App (recommended: https://github.com/apps/release-please)
          and provide its credentials as repo secrets.

          Required secrets:
            - RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_ID
            - RELEASE_PLEASE_PRIVATE_KEY

          Then the main Release Please workflow (.github/workflows/release-please.yaml)
          will generate an installation token and use it to open PRs and create Releases.

          See SETUP.md for step-by-step instructions.
